title: Predicting House Prices with the Ames Dataset
---

**Kaggle Competition - Advanced Regression Techniques** <br />  <br />  

The Ames Housing Dataset is used by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) participants to use multiple regression techniques to predict house prices given a set of features. It is the **"Hello World"** of Data Science problems. My own attempt in the notebook [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/Portfolio/blob/master/Housing.ipynb) has three objectives:

1. To estimate the sale price of properties based on their 'fixed' characteristics, such as neighborhood, lot size, number of stories etc
2. To see what part of the residuals of (1) can be explained by the renovations to the house
3. To determine the features in the housing data can predict abrnomal sales
