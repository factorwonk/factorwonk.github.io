title: Predicting House Prices with the Ames Dataset
---

**Kaggle Competition - Advanced Regression Techniques** <br />  <br />  

The Ames Housing Dataset is used by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) participants to use multiple regression techniques to predict house prices given a set of features. It is the **"Hello World"** of Data Science problems. My own attempt in the notebook [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/Portfolio/blob/master/Housing.ipynb) has three objectives:

1. To estimate the sale price of properties based on their 'fixed' characteristics, such as neighborhood, lot size, number of stories etc
2. To see what part of the residuals of (1) can be explained by the renovations to the house
3. To determine the features in the housing data can predict abrnomal sales

**A note about the target variable**
I am trying to predict the sale price of the house. Looking at the distribution of the sale prices it appears as though it follows a lognormal distribution as observed in the figure below.

*Figure 1: House Sale Prices appear to follow a LogNormal distribution*

Taking the log of sale price, I end up with a target variable which follows as normal distribution. This means the Log of Sale Price can be deconstructed into the sum of separate features.

**Feature Engineering is my jam**

While the data itself is relatively clean, the biggest component of this project is the feature engineering. We have some data on features for a house. To more accurately predict house prices, we
