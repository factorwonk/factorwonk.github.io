# Summary  
This post explores a subset of the NYC taxi dataset for the month of April 2013. I extract, transform and load the trip fare and trip details csv files into a sqlite database. I use this data to predict the fare and tip taxi drivers will receive. The repository containing my entire analysis is [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare) and presentation slides can be downloaded from [here](https://factorwonk.github.io/ADasTaxiNYC.pptx). 

### ETL 
The April 2013 taxi data is provided in two csv files: trip_details and trip_fares. I extract, transform and load these csv files into two separate tables: trips_table and fares_table in a SQLite database. I make subsequent calls to these tables in my EDA and modeling notebooks. The ETL process is detailed [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_createdb.ipynb).

### Data Cleaning
Each table is cleaned for outliers including restricting latitude and longitude co-ordinates to lie in beween (40.67, -74.027) and (40.85, -73.85). I remove trips that last for 0 minutes and 0 miles. I also restrict the dataset to all trips made within New York City alone and it's two closest airports: La Guardia and JFK International. This excludes trips made to Westchester and Nassau counties (Rate Code 4) as well as out of town trips (Rate Code 5) which are negotiated at a flat fee, where the odometer or trip time is not indicative of the distance or duration of the trip. While these actions may bias the results, **99.84%** of all trips in April 2013 were made within the city of New York. A few thousand trips have their payment registered as 'Disputed', 'No Charge' or 'Unknown'. These trips were excluded as overwhelmingly, passengers paid by credit card or cash. Finally, the NYC Taxi and Limousine company permits a maximum of 6 passengers in a 5 passenger taxicab, if the sixth passenger is a child under 7 who can sit on an adult's lap. I screen out all trips with more than 6 passengers.

### Data Merging  
Using taxi medallion as unqiue taxicab identifier, hack license as unique driver identifer, vendor id and pickup_datetime as common keys, I merge the two tables above and return just over 14 million rows of data. Going forward, I use the assignment questions to propel my EDA of the dataset. The complete data munging process is described in this [notebook](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_trips_data_munging.ipynb).

# Basic Questions

Complete notebook available [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_trips_data_analysis.ipynb).

## Q1. What is the distribution of the number of passengers in each cab?

Overwhelmingly taxi cabs are hailed by a sole passenger. More cabs are hailed by a single passenger than the _total_ number of cabs hailed by two or more passengers as shown in Figure 1.

## Q2. Do most customers pay with cash or card?

The results are pretty close, with nearly 54% of trips being paid for by credit card.

## Q3. What does the distribution of fare amounts look like?

The initial charge on a cab is $2.50, so I confirm there are no fares below this amount. The most expensive fare was $204 while most fares were under $35.

<p align="center">

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_fare_amt_dist.png)

Winsorizing the fare amount data by removing the top and bottom 1% shows the median fare amount is $9 as shown below. The bottom 5% of fare amounts is less than $5 while the top 95% of fares is higher than $24.

## Q4. What does the distribution of tip amount look like?

Interestingly, most passengers don't tip. While tip amounts via credit card can be verified, cash tips may be underreported by the taxi drivers themselves. Winsorizing the distribution of tip amounts, the modal tip amount is $0 while the median is $1.

## Q5. What does the dsitribution of total amount look like?

Given the relatively low tip amounts reported, the distribution of the total amount will be similar to the distribution of the fare amount. Winsorizing the total amount by removing the top and bottom 1% shows the median amount is just shy of $11.

## Q6. What are the top 5 busiest hours of the day?

Evenings after work or dinner appear to be the busiest which most cabs being hailed at 7pm. The heatmap below shows that Monday and Tuesday evenings as well as Friday and Saturday nights are when most taxi trips occur.

## Q7. What are the top 10 busiest locations in the city?

I filter latitude and longitude down to 2 decimal places and then sort through the most popular pickup and dropoff locations. These are identical and are all located in Manhattan, over 12.36 million trips. Rounding down latitude and longitude will increase clustering of pickup and dropoff points.

## Q8. Which trip has the highest standard deviation of travel times?

Each trip is uniquely defined by its pickup and dropoff co-ordinates. It is important to determine what minimum sample size of trips to use to calculate the standard deviation. If there is a unique trip for example, then we cannot calculate it's standard deviation of travel times. What minimum sample size do we need to determine the standard deviation of trip times? If there is a trip that has occured twice, one trip being 5 minutes long and one trip being an hour long, this trip will have a very high standard deviation based on a relatively small sample.

I make the following assumptions:

1. Margin of Error = 5%
2. Confidence Interval = 95% which is a Z-Score of 1.96
3. Standard Deviation = 0.5 (expecting 50% standard deviation will ensure large enough sample size)

The required sample size = ((1.96 x 0.5)/0.05)^2 = 384.16 = 385 trips, which is our minimum threshold

Travel times for trips originating from La Guardia airport to New York's boroughs have the largest variance. Apparently airport traffic **IS** a nightmare. 

## Q9. Which trip has the most consistent fares?

Using the same minimum sample size threshold, I now examine the top 5 fare amounts have the lowest standard deviation as these will be the most consistent fares. Figure 10 reveals that these are shorter non-Airport routes. Three of these trips begin at the same location in Manhattan. To get more color on the differences between trips it would be interesting to understand the time of day and day of the week the trips were occcuring on.

## Open Questions

## Q10. Which trips can we confidently use means as measures of central tendency to estimate fares, time taken?

As mentioned in question 8 above, certain trips may only occur once or twice, making calculations of central tendency based on these trips biased and erroneous. If the same trip takes twice as long for one taxi driver as it does for another, and our population is two trips, this skews calculated means and variances.

So how many occurences of the same trip - identified as beginning and ending at the same geocodes - are required before measures of central tendency can be calculated with confidence? Among 14 million trips, should the threshold be 50 occurences of the same trip or 1000? 

I make the following assumptions:

1. Margin of Error = 5%
2. Confidence Interval = 95% which is a Z-Score of 1.96
3. Standard Deviation = 0.5 (expecting 50% standard deviation will ensure large enough sample size)

The required sample size = ((1.96 x 0.5)/0.05)^2 = 384.16 = 385 trips, which is the minimum threshold of trip occurence to be comfortable calculating measures of central tendency to estimate fares.

## Q11. Build a model of Taxi Fare and tip given pickup and dropoff location

I examine the correlations between trip fare (and log fare) versus the features in my database. It stands to reason that several features will have a high correlation with the fare including how long the trip was and the distance covered.

<p align="center">
Figure 11
</p>

A Least Squares Regression model that uses trip time, distance, speed, tip amount and tolls amount to predict fare amount has an R-square of 95.6%. I show a line of best fit among the fare data in Figure 12 below. Note the scatter plot of predicted versus actual fares shows a cluster of fares at the $50 mark, which requires further investigation. Either these fares were rounded or mis-reported.

## Q12. If you were a taxi owner, how would you maximize your earnings in a day?

## Q13. If you were a taxi owner, how would you minimize your work time while retaining the average wages earned by a typical taxi in the dataset?

## Q14. If you run a taxi company with 10 taxis, how would you maximize your earnings?

## Further Questions

It would be interesting to see the impact of services such as Uber or Lyft on taxi demand over time. Also of interest would be the impact of precipation or temperature on a particular day on taxi demand, fare and tip. Finally, information on traffic congestion and road conditions would be invaluable to getting more insight from this dataset.
