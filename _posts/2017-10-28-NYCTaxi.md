title: Exploring NYC Taxi Data
---

**Summary**  <br />  <br />  This post explores a subset of the NYC taxi dataset made available to the public by the NY Taxi and Limousine company for the month of April 2013. I extract, transform and load the trip fare and trip details data for April 2013 from two separate csv files into a sqlite database. The notebook that details the ETL process is [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_createdb.ipynb) As required, I make calls to this SQLite database from my Jupyter notebook for the remainder of this project.

**Data Cleaning**
Each dataset is inspected for outliers

Using taxi medallion as unqiue taxicab identifier, hack license as unique driver identifer, vendor id and pickup_datetime as common keys, I merge the two tables above and return ~ 15 million + rows of data.

**What is the distribution of the number of passengers in each cab?**

**Do most customers pay with cash or card?** 

While most customers pay with credit cards, cash remains quite popular.

Are tips affected by whether people pay by cash or card?
