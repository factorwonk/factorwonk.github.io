**Summary**  <br />  <br />  This post explores a subset of the NYC taxi dataset for the month of April 2013. I extract, transform and load the trip fare and trip details csv files into a sqlite database. I use this data to predict the fare and tip taxi drivers will receive. The repository containing my analysis is [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare)

**ETL**  <br />  <br />  The April 2013 taxi data is provided in two csv files: trip_details and trip_fares. I extract, transform and load these csv files into two separate tables: trips_table and fares_table in a SQLite database. I make subsequent calls to these tables in my EDA and modeling notebooks. The ETL process is detailed [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_createdb.ipynb)

**Data Cleaning**   <br />  <br />  Each table is cleaned for outliers including restricting latitude and longitude co-ordinates to lie in beween (40.67, -74.027) and (40.85, -73.85). I remove trips that last for 0 minutes and 0 miles. I also restrict the dataset to all trips made within New York City alone and it's two closest airports: La Guardia and JFK International. This excludes trips made to Westchester and Nassau counties (Rate Code 4) as well as out of town trips (Rate Code 5) which are negotiated at a flat fee, where the odometer or trip time is not indicative of the distance or duration of the trip. While these actions may bias the results, **99.84%** of all trips in April 2013 were made within the city of New York. Finally, a few thousand trips have their payment registered as 'Disputed', 'No Charge' or 'Unknown'. These trips were excluded as overwhelmingly, passengers paid by credit card or cash.

Using taxi medallion as unqiue taxicab identifier, hack license as unique driver identifer, vendor id and pickup_datetime as common keys, I merge the two tables above and return ~ 14 million rows of data.

**What is the distribution of the number of passengers in each cab?**


**Do most customers pay with cash or card?** 

While most customers pay with credit cards, cash remains quite popular.


Are tips affected by whether people pay by cash or card?


**Further Questions**
It would be interesting to see the impact of services such as Uber or Lyft on taxi demand over time. I was struck by the relatively low percentage of taxis being taken to the Airports in particular.
