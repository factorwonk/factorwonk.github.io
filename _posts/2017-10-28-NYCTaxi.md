# Summary  
This post explores a subset of the NYC taxi dataset for the month of April 2013. I extract, transform and load the trip fare and trip details csv files into a sqlite database. I use this data to predict the fare and tip taxi drivers will receive. The repository containing my entire analysis is [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare) and presentation slides can be downloaded from [here](https://factorwonk.github.io/ADasTaxiNYC.pptx). 

### ETL 
The April 2013 taxi data is provided in two csv files: trip_details and trip_fares. I extract, transform and load these csv files into two separate tables: trips_table and fares_table in a SQLite database. I make subsequent calls to these tables in my EDA and modeling notebooks. The ETL process is detailed [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_createdb.ipynb).

### Data Cleaning
Each table is cleaned for outliers including restricting latitude and longitude co-ordinates to lie in beween (40.67, -74.027) and (40.85, -73.85). I remove trips that last for 0 minutes and 0 miles. I also restrict the dataset to all trips made within New York City alone and it's two closest airports: La Guardia and JFK International. This excludes trips made to Westchester and Nassau counties (Rate Code 4) as well as out of town trips (Rate Code 5) which are negotiated at a flat fee, where the odometer or trip time is not indicative of the distance or duration of the trip. While these actions may bias the results, **99.84%** of all trips in April 2013 were made within the city of New York. A few thousand trips have their payment registered as 'Disputed', 'No Charge' or 'Unknown'. These trips were excluded as overwhelmingly, passengers paid by credit card or cash. Finally, the NYC Taxi and Limousine company permits a maximum of 6 passengers in a 5 passenger taxicab, if the sixth passenger is a child under 7 who can sit on an adult's lap. I screen out all trips with more than 6 passengers.

### Data Merging  
Using taxi medallion as unqiue taxicab identifier, hack license as unique driver identifer, vendor id and pickup_datetime as common keys, I merge the two tables above and return just over 14 million rows of data. Going forward, I use the assignment questions to propel my EDA of the dataset. The complete data munging process is described in this [notebook](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_trips_data_munging.ipynb).

# Basic Questions

Complete notebook available [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_trips_data_analysis.ipynb).

## Q1. What is the distribution of the number of passengers in each cab?

Overwhelmingly taxi cabs are hailed by a sole passenger. More cabs are hailed by a single passenger than the _total_ number of cabs hailed by two or more passengers as shown in Figure 1.

## Q2. Do most customers pay with cash or card?

The results are pretty close, with nearly 54% of trips being paid for by credit card.

## Q3. What does the distribution of fare amounts look like?

The initial charge on a cab is $2.50, so I confirm there are no fares below this amount. The most expensive fare was $204 while most fares were under $35.

<p align="center">
Figure 3
</p>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_fare_amt_dist.png)

Winsorizing the fare amount data by removing the top and bottom 1% shows the median fare amount is $9 as shown below. The bottom 5% of fare amounts is less than $5 while the top 95% of fares is higher than $24.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_fare_amt_winsorized_dist.png)

## Q4. What does the distribution of tip amount look like?

Interestingly, most passengers don't tip. While tip amounts via credit card can be verified, cash tips may be underreported by the taxi drivers themselves. Winsorizing the distribution of tip amounts, the modal tip amount is $0 while the median is $1.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_tip_amt_winsorized_dist.png)

## Q5. What does the dsitribution of total amount look like?

Given the relatively low tip amounts reported, the distribution of the total amount will be similar to the distribution of the fare amount. Winsorizing the total amount by removing the top and bottom 1% shows the median amount is just shy of $11.

## Q6. What are the top 5 busiest hours of the day?

Evenings after work or dinner appear to be the busiest which most cabs being hailed at 7pm. The heatmap below shows that Monday and Tuesday evenings as well as Friday and Saturday nights are when most taxi trips occur.

## Q7. What are the top 10 busiest locations in the city?

I filter latitude and longitude down to 2 decimal places and then sort through the most popular pickup and dropoff locations. These are identical and are all located in Manhattan, over 12.36 million trips. Rounding down latitude and longitude will increase clustering of pickup and dropoff points.

## Q8. Which trip has the highest standard deviation of travel times?

Each trip is uniquely defined by its pickup and dropoff co-ordinates. It is important to determine what minimum sample size of trips to use to calculate the standard deviation. If there is a unique trip for example, then we cannot calculate it's standard deviation of travel times. What minimum sample size do we need to determine the standard deviation of trip times? If there is a trip that has occured twice, one trip being 5 minutes long and one trip being an hour long, this trip will have a very high standard deviation based on a relatively small sample.

I make the following assumptions:

1. Margin of Error = 5%
2. Confidence Interval = 95% which is a Z-Score of 1.96
3. Standard Deviation = 0.5 (expecting 50% standard deviation will ensure large enough sample size)

The required sample size = ((1.96 x 0.5)/0.05)^2 = 384.16 = 385 trips, which is the minimum threshold of trips applied. All routes with fewer than 385 trips over the month are excluded. This minimum exclusion is applied to answering all questions going forward.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_trips_max_stdev.png)

Travel times for trips originating from La Guardia airport to New York's boroughs have the largest variance. Apparently airport traffic **IS** a nightmare. 

## Q9. Which trip has the most consistent fares?

Using the same minimum sample size threshold, I now examine the top 5 fare amounts have the lowest standard deviation as these will be the most consistent fares. Figure 10 reveals that these are shorter non-Airport routes. Three of these trips begin at the same location in Manhattan. To get more color on the differences between trips it would be interesting to understand the time of day and day of the week the trips were occcuring on.

## Open Questions

## Q10. Which trips can we confidently use means as measures of central tendency to estimate fares, time taken?

As mentioned in question 8 above, certain trips may only occur once or twice, making calculations of central tendency based on these trips biased and erroneous. If the same trip takes twice as long for one taxi driver as it does for another, and our population is two trips, this skews calculated means and variances.

So how many occurences of the same trip - identified as beginning and ending at the same geocodes - are required before measures of central tendency can be calculated with confidence? Among 14 million trips, should the threshold be 50 occurences of the same trip or 1000? 

I make the following assumptions:

1. Margin of Error = 5%
2. Confidence Interval = 95% which is a Z-Score of 1.96
3. Standard Deviation = 0.5 (expecting 50% standard deviation will ensure large enough sample size)

The required sample size = ((1.96 x 0.5)/0.05)^2 = 384.16 = 385 trips, which is the minimum threshold of trip occurence over the month to be comfortable calculating measures of central tendency to estimate fares. Most of the trips which originate and end in Manhattan, including trips to La Guardia or JFK airports cross this threshold easily.

## Q11. Build a model of Taxi Fare and tip given pickup and dropoff location

I examine the correlations between trip fare (and log fare) versus the features in my database. It stands to reason that several features will have a high correlation with the fare including how long the trip was and the distance covered.

<p align="center">
Figure 11
</p>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_corrmat.png)

As there are millions of data points I use as RANSAC Regression model that uses trip time, distance, speed, tip amount and tolls amount to predict fare amount. The model has an R-square of 94.8%. I show a line of best fit among the fare data in Figure 12 below. The RANSAC model is a regression model which is robust to outliers in the y-axis. 

<p align="center">
Figure 12
</p>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_ransac_prediction.png)

Note the scatter plot of predicted versus actual fares shows a cluster of fares at the $50 mark, which requires further investigation. Either these fares were rounded or mis-reported by the taxi drivers. It may seem obvious that taxi drivers may negotiate lower fares up to $50. What is more puzzling are fares where our linear model predicts a high fare, but the taxi driver only reports $50. Are drivers pocketing these large fares? 

The notebook for answering this question is [here] (https://github.com/factorwonk/nyctaxifare/blob/master/nyctaxi_fare_modeling.ipynb).

## Q12. How would a taxi owner maximize earnings in a day?

The average daily revenue for taxi drivers is $480 per day. constraining factor here is time. I consider two approaches: looking at routes that generate the highest daily revenue and the routes that earn the highest revenue per hour. This way a taxi owner can either concentrate on areas that generate the highest revenue or lease out a medallion taxi to two drivers driving 12 hour shifts to maximize daily revenue.

Figure 13 plots all routes that generate that highest daily revenue and the total number of trips required to generate this revenue. Note all these trips are all based in Manhattan, except for one which is from Manhattan to La Guardia Airport.

<p align="center">
Figure 13
</p>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_trips_highest_revenue.png)

Note from question 8, the trip to LaGuardia airport has the highest standard deviation of travel times. As total amount charged will vary will the time of the trip, consistently relying on this trip for maximizing revenue may not be the best solution. A taxi owner could prioritize taxi bookings for Manhattan trips and potentially take on other trips if they crossed the average daily revenue of taxi drivers ($480).

Another way to consider this problem is that we are trying to maximize revenue in the available time. I build a feature which is the ratio of total_amount/time driven in hours and see which routes maximize the earnings per hour driven. These routes can be maximized upon. Note the assumptions here are that regardless of time of day these are the most profitable routes per hour. 

<p align="center">
Figure 14
</p>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nyctaxi_max_rev_per_hour.png)

Interestingly, these trips begin and end at the same geocode (rounded to 2 d.p.) and there appear to be intra-Manhattan geocode or intra-Airport geocode trips. These shorter trips can be used to maximize daily earnings. The results when trying to maximize the total amount earned per mile driven are identical.

## Q13. How would a taxi owner minimize work time while retaining average wages earned by a typical taxi in the dataset?

For this scenario taxi drivers could focus on those trips with variable travel times e.g. airport trips or out of town trips which have a higher rate per kilometer

## Q14. How would a taxi company with 10 taxis, maximize earnings?

Assume each taxi can be driven all day by 2 drivers working 12 hour shifts without wear and tear. This translates to 20 shifts per day for the taxi company. I would ensure taxis are available at the most popular pickup and dropoff locations and for trips with the most consistent fares. However you wouldn't want taxis working for the same company to undercut each other for the same fare.

My analysis so far reveals several insights for a smaller taxi company: 

a. Instruct taxi drivers to focus on the routes with the highest earnings per hour (or earnings per mile). This would keep taxis working within smaller areas (zipcodes) and would allow the company to keep a fleet of cars working airport shifts and another fleet working Manhattan island shifts. The difficulty here is whether taxis could legally deny providing service to passengers who want to travel out of these zones

b. Once a taxi driver has earned half the average daily wage of taxi driver ($240) during their shift, give them the option to engage out of town fares or those fares whose trip times have higher standard deviation e.g. Manhattan to LaGuardia  fares or possibly out of town fares where the total amount earned may be higher.

c. The worst time to have a taxi out for service are weeknights or Friday and Saturday nights as these tend to be the busiest times. Get taxis serviced during the day.

d. The most popular routes may be overcrowded, so it may be worth focusing on trips that generate the highest total revenue with the smallest number of individual trips, as shown below.

## Further Questions

It would be interesting to see the impact of services such as Uber or Lyft on taxi demand over time. Also of interest would be the impact of precipation or temperature on a particular day on taxi demand, fare and tip. Finally, information on traffic congestion and road conditions would be invaluable to getting more insight from this dataset.
