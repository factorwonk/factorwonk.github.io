**Jeremy Howard's fast.ai study group, 2018** <br /> <br /> In February, I was invited by [Paul Conyngham](https://twitter.com/paul_conyngham), to join a study group every Saturday to tackle the first seven weeks of Jeremy Howard's [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/start.html) **Deep Learning for Coders** course, under the kind auspices of [The Domain Group](https://www.domain.com.au/). I was intrigued as the course came highly recommended by my machine learning mentor [Greg Baker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solresol/).

In this repository I have tried to document everything I learned over those seven weeks. While we learned the material together in groups, the Jupyter notebooks posted here represent **my own attempt** at the assigned homework.
