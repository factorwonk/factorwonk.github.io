**Jeremy Howard's fast.ai Study Group, 2018** <br /> <br /> In February, I was invited by Sydney Machine Learning's [Paul Conyngham](https://twitter.com/paul_conyngham), to join a Saturday morning study group to tackle the first seven weeks of Jeremy Howard's [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/start.html) **Deep Learning for Coders** MOOC, under the kind auspices of [The Domain Group](https://www.domain.com.au/). I was intruiged, as the course came highly recommended by my mentor [Greg Baker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solresol/). In this repository I have tried to document everything I learned. While we studied the material together, the Jupyter notebooks here represent **my own attempt** at extending concepts covered in the MOOC with [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) sourced datasets.
