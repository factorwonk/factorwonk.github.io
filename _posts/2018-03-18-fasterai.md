**Jeremy Howard's fast.ai Study Group, 2018** <br /> <br /> In February, I was invited by Sydney Machine Learning's [Paul Conyngham](https://twitter.com/paul_conyngham), to join a Saturday morning study group to tackle the first seven weeks of Jeremy Howard's [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/start.html) **Deep Learning for Coders** MOOC, under the kind auspices of [The Domain Group](https://www.domain.com.au/). I was excited to be part of the study group, as the course came highly recommended by my mentor [Greg Baker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/solresol/). 

In this ongoing post I will try to document everything I learned. While we studied the material together, the Jupyter notebooks here represent **my own work** at extending concepts covered in the MOOC with [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) sourced datasets and competitions.

**Facial Recognition: Tony Stark or Elon Musk?**

Robert Downey Jr reinvigorated his career with his portrayal of Tony Stark in [Marvel's Iron Man (2008)](http://marvel.com/movies/movie/19/iron_man) movies. A little known fact is that Downey (hereafter: RDJ) based his portrayal of the genious, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist on serial entrepreneur [Elon Musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/09/elon-musk-the-real-life-iron-man). I wanted to use a Convolutional Neural Network, trained on [ImageNet data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet) to train a single label image classification model to distinguish between photos of RDJ and Elon Musk.

The input for this convolutional neural network will be photos of Elon Musk and Robert Downey Jr. Each photo will be transformed into a **rank 3 tensor** with dimensions *height x width x 3* where 3 represents each of the Red, Blue and Green channels that combine to form a pixel color. Each pixel in an image will have a value from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

Our output activation layer for this Convolutional Neural Network will be a sigmoid function which transforms the result of the previous layer into a **0** (RDJ) or **1** (Musk) classification, based on a preset threshold. Here we use the threshold 0.5, meaning that any image which is processed by the penultimate layer of our CNN and has an output value greater than or equal to 0.5 will be assigned to Musk otherwise Downey.

We use a [Resnet30](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model, trained for 10 epochs with a learning rate = 0.01, pre-trained on the ImageNet database. The learning rate is a hyperparameter representing how quickly or how slowly we want to update the weights of our model.

A first pass using this model reveals the images that the architecture is more sure about

and the images it's not quite so sure about. Note that the architecture seems to be having a tougher time identifying Elon as opposed to Downey.
