title: Webscraping for predictive features of car sales
---

**Webscraping** <br />  <br />  Like similar online automobile sales websites, <https://www.carsales.com.au> allow prospective car buyers in Australia to view second hand car sales from private sellers and/or dealerships. Car sales are organized by state, seller and car type among other features. The well structured website makes it a suitable candidate for scraping using Python's [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library after which we can test whether car sales prices can be predicted using scraped features. We use Natural Language Processing courtesy of Python's [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/) library to determine whether any words in the seller's description of the car are more or less helpful in predicting car price.

**Car Brands and Features**

I scrape for the most popular car brands sold in NSW, Australia:
1. Toyota
2. Mazda
3. BMW
4. Volkswagen
5. Ford
6. Audi
7. Volvo

and my features of interest include
* Car make
* Sale Price
* Color
* Odometer
* Transmission
* Body
* Drive Type
* Engine
* Build Date
* Seller Description

The seller description contains a blurb from the seller describing the car. We use NLP
