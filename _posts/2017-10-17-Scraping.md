title: Webscraping for predictive features of car sales
---

**Webscraping** <br />  <br />  Like similar online automobile sales websites, <https://www.carsales.com.au> allow prospective car buyers in Australia to view second hand car sales from private sellers and/or dealerships. Car sales are organized by state, seller and car type among other features. The structured nature of the website makes it easy to scrape using Python's [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library after which we can test whether car sales prices can be predicted using scraped features.
