**Correlation between Teen Pregnancy Rates and SAT score**

A basic project covering exploratory data analysis on the SAT verbal and math exams in each U.S. state. I examine the impact of teen pregnancies on participation rates and SAT scores. SAT scores were provided. Teen pregnancy rates are births per 1000 girls aged 15-19 available from [here](https://thenationalcampaign.org/data/compare/1701).

Note the negative relationship between teen pregnancy rate and the SAT participation rate

**EDA on Drug Use data by age**

Looking at the correlation matrix of drug use amongst all age groups, note the strong correlations between alcohol, marijuane and cocaine usage. It would suggest that alcohol and marijuana are gateway drugs that can lead to cocaine usage.

To understand why alcohol and marijuana usage is so predominant we look at their use among underage users. In America (where this data is from) the legal age for drinking in 21.
