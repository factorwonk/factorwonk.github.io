**Correlation between Teen Pregnancy Rates and SAT score**

A basic project covering exploratory data analysis on the SAT verbal and math exams in each U.S. state. I examine the impact of teen pregnancies on participation rates and SAT scores. SAT scores were provided. Teen pregnancy rates are births per 1000 girls aged 15-19 available from [here](https://thenationalcampaign.org/data/compare/1701).
