title: Predicting road accidents among Fleetrisk Drivers
---

**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br />  Bad drivers cost insurers and transportation companies such as [Uber](http://www.uber.com), money. Predicting which drivers will have accidents though, is difficult. [Academic research](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/47282/2/47282.pdf), on the impact of driver personality and cognitive skills has focused on mature age drivers and is untested against actual driving behavior. 

[Fleetrisk](www.fleetrisk.com) screens new drivers based on several cognitive, emotional and personality tests. 394 drivers were subsequently monitored for several months on their daily road trips, with telematics data collected from sensors fitted to their vehicles. 52 of these drivers had one or more road accidents over this period. Could we have made use of Feetrisk data to determine which drivers were more likely to have accidents, or to ascertain which of the "good" drivers haven't had an accident yet?

This data science project provides an excellent opportunity to not only validate academic theories on road accidents but also to determine
