title: Predicting road accidents among Fleetrisk Drivers
---

**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br />  Bad drivers cost insurers and transportation companies such as [Uber](http://www.uber.com), money. Predicting which drivers will have accidents is difficult. [Academic research](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/47282/2/47282.pdf), on the impact of cognition on driving behavior remains focused on mature age drivers and untested against actual driving behavior. [Fleetrisk] are a driving behavior monitoring startup that screens new drivers based on a series of cognitive, emotional and personality tests and subsequently monitors their vehicles, collecting driving event level telematics.
