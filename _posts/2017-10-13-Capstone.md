**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br />  Bad drivers cost insurers and transportation companies such as Uber (http://www.uber.com), money. Predicting which drivers will have accidents is difficult. [Academic research] (https://eprints.qut.edu.au/47282/2/47282.pdf), on the impact of cognition on driving behavior remains focused on mature age drivers and untested against actual driving behavior.

Predicting which drivers will have accidents is difficult. a similar amount as the oceans, so we can say land conversion harms human ability to fight climate change. But how do we track this issue to know what we should do about it?
