title: Predicting road accidents among Fleetrisk Drivers
---

**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br />  Bad drivers cost insurers and transportation companies such as [Uber](http://www.uber.com), money. Predicting which drivers will have accidents though, is difficult. [Academic research](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/47282/2/47282.pdf), on the impact of driver personality and cognitive skills has focused on mature age drivers and is untested against actual driving behavior. 

[Fleetrisk](www.fleetrisk.com) screens new drivers based on several cognitive, emotional and personality tests. In the provided dataset, 394 drivers were screened and subsequently monitored for several months on daily road trips, with telematics data collected from sensors fitted to their cars. 52 of these drivers had one or more road accidents over this period. Could we have made use of Feetrisk data to determine which drivers were more likely to have accidents, or to ascertain which of the "good" drivers haven't had an accident yet?

**Fleetrisk Data**

Transport companies hire Fleetrisk to administer tests, similar in fashion to computerized hazard perception tests, to rank employed drivers by cognitive, empathy and personality traits. Driver's vehicles are fitted with sensors which monitor every speeding, accelerating, braking and cornering event and the speed at which these events occur. Drivers do not receive real time feedback while driving and are assumed, over time, to revert back to their normal driving patterns.

The longer people drive, the greater the likelihood of road accidents. Fleetrisk records each accident claims made by its drivers. For every accident, we have information on the date, severity and cost of the accident.
