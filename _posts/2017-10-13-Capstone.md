title: Predicting road accidents among Fleetrisk Drivers
---

**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br />  Bad drivers cost insurers and transportation companies such as [Uber](http://www.uber.com), money. Predicting which drivers will have accidents is difficult. [Academic research](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/47282/2/47282.pdf), on the impact of cognition on driving behavior remains focused on mature age drivers and untested against actual driving behavior. 

[Fleetrisk](www.fleetrisk.com) screens new drivers based on several cognitive, emotional and personality tests. These drivers are subsequently monitored on their trips with event level telematics data collected from sensors fitted to their vehicles. Can we use the metrics from Fleetrisk's screening process to determine which drivers will have accidents?
