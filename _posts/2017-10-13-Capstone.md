title: Predicting road accidents among Fleetrisk Drivers
---

**General Assembly Data Science Final Project**  <br />  <br />  Bad drivers cost insurers and transport companies money. Predicting which drivers will have accidents is difficult. [Academic research](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/47282/2/47282.pdf), on the impact of driver personality and cognition is focused on mature age drivers and remains untested against actual driving behavior. 

[Fleetrisk](www.fleetrisk.com) screens new drivers based on cognitive, emotional and personality tests. In our sample, 394 of these drivers were monitored for six months on daily road trips, with vehicle telematics data collected from sensors fitted to their cars. 52 of these drivers had road accidents over this period. Can we make use of Feetrisk data to determine which drivers were more likely to have accidents? Are there patterns that allow us to predict which drivers will never have an accident?

**Fleetrisk Data**

Transportation companies such as [Uber](http://www.uber.com), hire Fleetrisk to administer tests, similar to computerized hazard perception tests, to rank employed drivers by cognitive, empathy and personality traits. These factors align with the [Big Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) personality model and provides Fleetrisk with some understanding of the psychological makeup of potential drivers. 

Fleetrisk then fits these driver's vehicles with sensors to monitor every speeding, accelerating, braking and cornering event and the speed at which these events occur. Drivers receive no real time feedback and over time will revert to normal driving behavior.

The longer people drive, the greater the likelihood of an accident occuring. Fleetrisk records each accident claim made by every driver being monitored. Our sample contains the date, severity and cost of each accident among other variables. Whether the driver was at fault or not, is not recorded.

Looking at the relationship between cognitive, empathy and personality traits with whether a driver had and accident, we note unanimously low correlations among all factors. This does not bode well for Logistic Classification models relying on a linear combination of one or more of these personality features. This is corroborated by a simple OLS regression model that uses whether a driver had an accident or note as the target and the cognitive, empathy and personality factors as its features.

**Time for some Data Science**


**Takeaways**

1. Drive slower
2. High reaction speed drivers in particular need to drive slower.

**Cost Function**

Only 13% of all drivers in our sample had an accident. An estimator that predicted all 394 drivers were accident free would have an 87% accuracy. This is a typical example of an imbalanced class problem, and traditional techniques to accomodate this such as upsampling the minority class would end up skewing our results.

Instead, we design our cost function around misclassifying good and bad drivers. The cost to Fleetrisk of advertising for an vetting drivers for transportation companies is $25. The median cost of an accident is $2200. Put another way, if we were to reject a driver because we believed they were going to have an accident, but they were actually a good driver, it would cost Fleetrisk $25. On the other hand if we vetted a driver as being "good" but they then went on to have an accident, the cost to Fleetrisk would be $2200.

Predict   | Actual   | Cost
--------- | -------- | ------
Bad       |  Good    | $25
Good      |  Bad     | $2200

Note the penalty associated with bad drivers in this case is 100 times greater than with good drivers, so we've adjusted for our imbalanced class problem.
