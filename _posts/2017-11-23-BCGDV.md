title: Clustering and Classification Analysis
---


**Summary**  <br />  <br /> For the unsupervised learning problem I use a K-Means algorithm to distinguish individual clusters of data by maximising the silhouette coefficient. When the dimensions of the original dataset are reduced using PCA, two clusters of datapoints are quite close to one another (similar variances) along the first principal component and are grouped into a single cluster by K-Means. A density based algorithm fares better at identifying three clusters but depending on the parameters certain datapoints are as classed as outliers. The classification task is complicated by an imbalanced class. 70% of the target variable is of Class 1 meaning that a model that classifies every value of the target variable as 1 will have an accuracy of 70%. Since the area under an ROC AUC curve is insensitive to imabalanced classes I use a hypertuned Logistic Classifier to maximize this metric and identify the most important features.

## Q1. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) Analysis

K-Means is one of the most intuitive and easiest to implement unsupervised learning algorithms to discover subgroups in our data. It begins by randomly generating centroids in our dataset, finding the (euclidean) distance from each point to the centroid and recalculating centroid position until stopping criteria are met. The only parameter we need specify is the number of centroids (k). To know whether our clustering is any good, we combine notions of *cohesion* (how far points in a cluster are from their centroid) and *separation* (how far clusters are from each other). Figure 1 shows the silhouette coefficient is maximized when we have two clusters in the provided dataset.
