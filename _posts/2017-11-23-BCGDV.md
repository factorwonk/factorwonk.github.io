title: Clustering and Classification Analysis
---


**Summary**  <br />  <br /> For the unsupervised learning problem I use a K-Means algorithm to distinguish individual clusters of data by maximising the silhouette coefficient. When the dimensions of the original dataset are reduced using PCA, two clusters of datapoints are quite close to one another (similar variances) along the first principal component and are grouped into a single cluster by K-Means. A density based algorithm fares better at identifying three clusters but depending on the parameters certain datapoints are as classed as outliers. The classification task is complicated by an imbalanced class. 70% of the target variable is of Class 1 meaning that a model that classifies every value of the target variable as 1 will have an accuracy of 70%. Since the area under an ROC AUC curve is insensitive to imabalanced classes I use a hypertuned Logistic Classifier to maximize this metric and identify the most important features.
