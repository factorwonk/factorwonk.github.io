title: Clustering and Classification Analysis
---


**Summary**  <br />  <br /> For the unsupervised learning problem I use a K-Means algorithm to distinguish individual clusters of data by maximising the silhouette coefficient. When the dimensions of the original dataset are reduced using PCA, two clusters of datapoints are quite close to one another (similar variances) along the first principal component and are grouped into a single cluster by K-Means. A density based algorithm fares better at identifying three clusters but depending on the parameters certain datapoints are as classed as outliers. The classification task is complicated by an imbalanced class. 70% of the target variable is of Class 1 meaning that a model that classifies every value of the target variable as 1 will have an accuracy of 70%. Since the area under an ROC AUC curve is insensitive to imabalanced classes I use a hypertuned Logistic Classifier to maximize this metric and identify the most important features.

The repository containing code for both sections is [here](https://github.com/factorwonk/bcgdv) and presentation slides are [here](https://factorwonk.github.io/bcgdv.pdf).

## Section 1: Unsupervised Learning (Cluster) Analysis

K-Means is one of the most intuitive and easiest to implement unsupervised learning algorithms to discover subgroups in data. It begins by randomly generating centroids in our dataset, finding the (Euclidean) distance from each point to the centroid and recalculating the centroid position until stopping criteria are met. The only parameter we need to pre-specify is the number of centroids (k). To know whether our clustering is any good, we combine notions of *cohesion* (how far points in a cluster are from their centroid) and *separation* (how far clusters are from each other) into a ratio called the Silhouette Coefficient which I attempt to maximize. Figure 1 shows this ratio is maximized when we group our dataset into two clusters.

I use Principal Components Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the original dataset which had 4 features to a 2-Dimensional plane, Figure 2 shows the original dataset on the left and the 2 clusters identified by the K-Means algorithm on the right. Here we see a shortcoming of K-Means. As the variances of the 'b' and 'c' groups are similar along the first principal component, K-Means identifies it as a single cluster, placing its centroid in between the two groups, essentially grouping 'b' and 'c' together into a single point.

What if we specified that we wanted 3 clusters? Although its Silhouette Coefficient is lower, initializing 3 centroids will do a marginally better job at identifying 3 clusters of data, even though certain points of group 'c' are classified as group 'b'. Put another way, the outlying (top right) points of group 'c' shift the group's centroid of that cluster to the top-right of the two dimensional plane.

Out of interest I examine how well a density based clustering algorithm - **DBSCAN** - distinguishes between the three groups. Unlike K-Means, we don't have to pre-specify the number of clusters we'd like, instead merely providing a minimum neighbor count and a maximum radius. Visually inspecting Figure 4 this clustering algorithm appears to do a better job than K-Means at identifying 3 clusters of data. Note the downside of this clustering algorithm is that datapoints that cannot be grouped into one of the 3 clusters are placed into a 'noise' clusters.

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Clustering Algorithms**

While K-Means is intuitive and less computationally intensive especially if 'k' is kept low, compared to other clusterers, there are drawbacks. The algorithm is scale dependent and not suitable for data with widely varying shapes or densities as it usually relies on the variance of the distribution of the dataset being spherical. Clusters are also assumed to be of similar sizes and we have to specify the number of cluster centers *a priori*.

An alternative is the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm which groups together closely packed points given a minimum number of neighbors and a threshold radius. Unlike K-Means we do not have to specify the number of clusters a priori, although we do specify a neighbor count and radius. It is computationally more intensive than K-Means making it problematic when scaling up to higher dimensional data. DBSCAN will categorize points as 'noise' if they are located far away from the cluster center.

Finally, top-down hierarchical clustering, begins by dividing the dataset into 2 clusters and repeating this process within each cluster, until all the clusters are too small or similar. Bottom-up hierarchical clustering, starts with each data item being its own cluster, combining two items that are most similar into a larger cluster and repeating this process until all the clusters left are too dissimilar. K-Means clustering works by dividing data into k sets simultaneously. Hierarchical clustering works well with non-spherical data and as the algorithm is deterministic, you end up with the same cluster each time. K-Means on the other hand, begins with a random draw of the centroids and may yield slightly different clustering results on different runs of the algorithm.

## Section 2: Classification Analysis

To predict whether the target variable is a 0 or 1, I used a Logistic Classifier which transforms an underlying linear model using a (sigmoid) function. If the transformed value exceeds a threshold (by default 50%) this maps the output to Class 1 otherwise to Class 0. By identifying features with the highest explanatory power, a Logistic Classifier leads to a more intuitive (linear) explanation than using a CART Classifier such as a Random Forest or a Boosted Decision Tree, even though the latter may have higher classification accuracy. With the coefficients of the logistic regressor, we can say *the more of A6-A10 and A13, the greater the likelihood of being in Class 1*. To benchmark the performance of my Logistic Classifier, I use a similarly intuitive KNN Classifier, which groups clients into Classes based on their neighbors e.g. the travel habits of  residents who live close to the city are similar. 

**EDA and Preprocessing**

Exploratory Data Analysis reveals 70% of the target variable is Class 1 and 30% is Class 0. This imbalanced class problem means that any model that predicts the entire target variable is Class 1 has a **70% Accuracy**. To gauge how well my classifer has done, I use the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve as my performance evaluation metric. As it only compares incorrect labelling assignments - the true positive rate versus the false positive rates - it is unaffected by the distribution of class labels.

Figure 5 examines the distribution of all features and target values. Features A21 to A24 are categorical, able to take values A, B or C, and do not appear. I use dummy variables represent these categorical points, dropping A21_A, A22_A, A23_A and A24_A to avoid the *dummy variable trap*. These binarized features are then added back to the quantitative features: A1 - A20.

Note the scales of variables A1-A3 are different to the remaining variables and that A2 in particular has a large number of outliers. To tackle the differing scales as well as the outliers in the distribution, I apply a robust standardizer to scale these features. Finally I note the minimum values of A7 and A8 are 0 whereas the minimum values for all other non-binary features are 1. I assume that zero is **not** a placeholder for NULL values and actually represents the value of zero.

**Logistic Classifier**

As a baseline, I use a Dummy Classification model which takes the mean of each robust-standardized feature as a regressor and uses these to to classify the target variable into Class 1 or Class 0. The Dummy Classifier has an accuracy score of 56.364% and the area under the ROC curve is 50.3%. True to it's name, this Dummy Classifier is no better than random guessing. Note that in terms of accuracy score this underperforms a model that simply predicts the target variable is always Class 1.

I employ a Logistic Classifier which transforms a linear model of all 24 features using a sigmoid function to predict whether the target variable will be Class 1 or 0. Running a Stratified 10 fold cross validation (to avoid overfitting) the model has an average ROC_AUC of 75.2%. I run a gridsearch optimization to determine the optimal value of the inverse regularization parameter 'C' that maximizes ROC_AUC to 76.1%. The optimal value of 'C' is 0.1 which is small and suggests a strong degree of regularization.

**ROC Curve and Top Features**

This ROC curve an easy way to visualize the performance of a binary classifier. The x-axis of the ROC represents the false positive rate (% times the model predicts 1 when the class is 0) while the y-axis represents the true positive rate (ability to accurately predict a class). We want to maximize the area under the ROC curve which occurs at the top left of Figure 6. Here the True positive rate is 1 and the false positive rate is 0. An AUC of 1.0 is a perfect model, where the classifier never makes a mistake.

The area under this ROC curve (score) is 79%, which means we make a mistake 21% of the time when classifying clients as 1 or 0. This is better than random guessing or employing the dummy classifier. Running a 10 fold cross-validation across the sample, drops the area under the curve to 76.1%. 

The top 5 important features in Figure 7 below. Based on their coefficients, a linear combination of A6-A10 and A13 has the highest predictive power for the Logistic Classifier.

Here is where use of a Logistic Classifier provides us with a comprehensible result. Looking at these coefficients, we can say that more of features A6-10 and A13 we have the more likely we will fall into a particular class.

**Final Thoughts: Alternative approaches of tackling the imbalanced class problem**

A simple logistic classifier is 79% accurate at classifying clients into Class 1 or 2. I would be interested in exploring how a Random Forest Classifier or a Boosted Decision tree performed on this dataset but this woulc come at the cost of comprehensibility. 

I used the ROC curve given its insensitivity to imbalanced classes. An alternative technique is the synthesis of new minority classes using Chawla’s SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) system. The idea is to create new minority examples by interpolating between existing ones. A disadvantage of SMOTE is that it operates by interpolating between minority examples, so it can only generate examples within the body of available examples—never outside.
