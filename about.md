Some information about you!

### Abhishek Das, Data Scientist with an interest in applied A.I.
I'm a Data Scientist who graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course in October 2017. I used to work as a Quantitative Analyst and Portfolio Manager at Challenger and Dimensional Fund Advisors respectively. I used feature engineering and supervised machine learning methods, to test quantitative global equity market strategies. 

I fell in love with Data Science a year ago after visiting the Strata Data conference. Through a series of talks by Hilary Mason and DJ Patil among others, I came to realize the power of Data Science in empowering us to answer interesting real world problems.

Data Science brings together the best of statistical inference, algorithmic precision and distributed computing. I'm particularly excited about the applications of predictive machine learning techniques for businesses. This is why I chose to work with a startup on predicting drivers more likely to be involved in an accident.
