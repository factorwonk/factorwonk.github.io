### Data Scientist | A.I. Engineer
I'm a PhD in Quantitative Finance turned Data Scientist. Working as a Quantitative Portfolio Analyst and Portfolio Manager at Challenger Limited and Dimensional Fund Advisors, I used feature engineering and supervised machine learning models to test and run quantitative global equity strategies. In October 2017, I graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course.

I fell in love with Data Science after sitting through a series of talks by Hilary Mason and DJ Patil at the 2016 Strata Data Conference. Data Science brings together the best of statistical inference, algorithmic precision and distributed computing. I'm excited about the applications of predictive machine learning techniques for businesses which is why I chose to work with a startup, predicting drivers more likely to be involved in an accident.
