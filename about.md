### Data Scientist | A.I. Enthusiast
I'm an academically trained researcher with over six years of industry experience in quantitative asset management and data science. I began my career at [S&P Global Market Intelligence](https://marketintelligence.spglobal.com/client-solutions/products/products/clarifi) building, testing and deploying supervised and unsupervised machine trading models for quantitative hedge funds. After running a $3 Billion global quantitative equities portfolio at [Dimensional Fund Advisors](https://au.dimensional.com/), I returned to data analysis creating a factor attribution system for [Challenger Funds Management](https://www.challenger.com.au/funds/index.asp). My research into using twitter data for building sentiment based factor models led me to discover big data engineering and I reskilled myself as a Data Scientist.

My new career has allowed me to tackle a myriad of interesting problems. I worked for a startup that helped ride for share services such as Uber, classify which of its drivers were more likely to have an accident. In my current role at [BCG Digital Ventures](https://bcgdv.com), I work in the domains of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. My work in NLP in particular has led me to implement and deploy algorithmic and deep learning models to gain value from our corporate partner's unstructured data.

Throughout my work experience I have been client facing, engaging directly with stakeholders at all levels and presenting to diverse audiences at both academic and investor conferences. At BCG, I regularly provide Data Science updates to corporate venture board members.
