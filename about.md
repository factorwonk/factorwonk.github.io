### Data Scientist | A.I. Enthusiast
I'm an academically trained researcher with over six years of industry experience in quantitative asset management and data science. I began my career at [S&P Global Market Intelligence](https://marketintelligence.spglobal.com/client-solutions/products/products/clarifi) building, testing and deploying supervised and unsupervised machine trading models for quantitative hedge funds. After running a $3 Billion global quantitative equities portfolio at [Dimensional Fund Advisors](https://au.dimensional.com/), I returned to data analysis creating a factor attribution system for [Challenger Funds Management](https://www.challenger.com.au/funds/index.asp). My research into using twitter data for building sentiment based factor models led me to discover big data engineering and I upskilled myself as a Data Scientist.

My new career has allowed me to tackle a myriad of interesting problems. I consulted with an [insurance startup](https://www.fleetrisk.com.au/) that helped ride for share services such as Uber, classify which of its drivers were more likely to have accidents. At [BCG Digital Ventures](https://bcgdv.com), I worked in the domains of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. My work in NLP led me to deploy algorithmic and deep learning models to provide insight into our corporate partner's unstructured data.

Throughout my work, I have engaged directly with stakeholders at all levels. At BCG DV, I provide in person, monthly Data Science updates to venture board members on our current endeavors. I have also presented to diverse audiences at academic and investor conferences. I love working on challenging problems with smart but kind people. My long term goal is to be an A.I. Engineer.
